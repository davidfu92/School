1) Gradient descent can be applied to any objective function (True of False).
True
2) Gradient descent can always find the global optimal (True of False).
False - Local Optimal
3) Perception algorithm always converges (True of False).
True only if data set is linearly seperable
4) MSE can always find a decision hyperplane that correctly classifies the two classes, if they are linearly separable (True of False).
True
5) SVM is an unsupervised learning method (True of False).
False it is supervised


Quiz 5

• GMM is an unsupervised approach.
True
• GMM works for hard assignment, and K-means works for soft assignment.
False the other way around
• K-Means works in an iterative manner.
True
• The E step of EM approach handles parameter estimation for the current responsibilities. • K-Means finds the global optima.
True
